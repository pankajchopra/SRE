   - Google Agent Builder for individual agent development
   - LangChain for enhanced language model interactions within the multi-agent system

8. **API Gateway and Integration Layer**
   - Unified interface for accessing various data sources
   - Efficient communication between agents and external services

9. **Security and Compliance Module**
   - Data privacy and regulatory compliance across all agents
   - Role-based access control for agent interactions

10. **Performance Optimization Layer**
    - Load balancing and auto-scaling for the multi-agent system
    - Efficient resource allocation among agents

11. **User Interface**
    - Multi-modal interaction support (text, voice, potentially image)
    - Transparent presentation of multi-agent interactions when needed

## Multi-Agent Collaboration

- Blackboard Pattern: Centralized knowledge sharing among agents
- Publish-Subscribe System: Asynchronous communication between agents
- Mediator Pattern: Main Controller manages inter-agent communications

## Cost Optimization Strategies

- Use of smaller, specialized models for individual agents
- Efficient task distribution to minimize redundant processing
- Tiered architecture for handling queries of varying complexity

## Conclusion

By incorporating multi-agent orchestration, our chatbot system provides a highly flexible, scalable, and intelligent solution for enterprise communication and information retrieval. This approach allows for handling complex scenarios while maintaining efficiency and cost-effectiveness.
