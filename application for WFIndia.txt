Subject: Request for Temporary Remote Work from India

Dear [Manager's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to inform you about an unexpected family situation that I need to address. A close family member, who is over 75 years old, recently suffered a head injury and is currently recovering in the hospital. Unfortunately, there is no one available to be with him during this critical time, and I may need to travel to Hyderabad, India, to provide support for a period of three to four weeks.

Given that my potential visit will be after the October release (scheduled for October 17th), I would like to inquire if there is an option for me to work remotely from India during this period. Since I will be near our Hyderabad office, I am also open to the possibility of working from there if necessary.

In situations where I may need to work from the hospital, I am confident that I can continue to perform my duties using a virtual computer in the cloud or via VDI, either from my personal computer or from the laptop issued by ABC India.

I appreciate your understanding and consideration of this request, and I am happy to discuss any details further to ensure smooth operations during my absence.

Thank you for your time and support.

Warm regards,
[Your Name]

This version formalizes the request while conveying the urgency and flexibility of your situation.


Dear [Manager's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to inform you of a personal situation that has arisen and to seek your approval for a temporary work arrangement.

A close family member, who is over 75 years old, recently suffered a head injury and is currently recovering in a hospital in Hyderabad, India. Unfortunately, there is no one available to provide the necessary care during their recovery. As a result, I may need to travel to India to be with them for a period of approximately three to four weeks, starting after our October release on October 17th.

In light of this, I would like to request permission to work remotely during this time. If feasible, I could also work from our Hyderabad office, though I anticipate that I may need to work from the hospital on occasion. I am prepared to utilize either a virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) or a cloud-based solution to ensure secure access to the company's systems, using either my personal computer or a laptop issued by ABC India.

I understand the importance of maintaining productivity, and I am committed to ensuring that my responsibilities and deliverables are met without disruption during this period. Your consideration of this request is greatly appreciated, and I am happy to discuss any details further if needed.

Thank you for your understanding and support.

Kind regards,
