**Hackathon-Winning Voice Command POC evolving to Intelligent Chatbot**

**Project Summary:**  Winning hackathon POC for voice-activated financial command execution and app launch, demonstrating speech-to-text workflow streamlining.  Evolved into an intelligent client service chatbot project (in progress). LLM-agnostic design with adaptable agentic framework.

**Hackathon POC (Winning Entry): Voice-Driven Command & App Launch**

*   **Offline Speech-to-Text:** VOSK engine for offline voice command conversion.
*   **TensorFlow Intent Model:**  TensorFlow model for intent identification (e.g., "open account," "show stock chart") and entity extraction.
*   **API-Driven App Integration:** APIs (e.g., REST) for:
    *   Client Data Retrieval (from internal DB).
    *   Contextual Launch of Apps (e.g., account software, FactSet) passing client/stock context.
*   **Ambiguity Resolution:** Logic for clarifying ambiguous client names via account number options.
*   **Key Technologies:** TensorFlow, VOSK, Python, APIs.
*   **Achievement:** 1st Place - [Hackathon Name/Theme] for voice-driven financial workflow innovation.

**Evolution to Intelligent Client Chatbot (In Progress):**

*   Built upon POC success to create a comprehensive client service chatbot.
*   LLM-agnostic and adaptable to agentic frameworks (e.g., Google Cloud Agent Builder).
*   Expanded features: RAG, secure APIs, LLM-enhanced intent understanding (detailed in full project description).

**Key Skills:** Speech-to-Text, NLP, TensorFlow, API Integration, Agentic Frameworks, LLM Concepts, Problem Solving, Innovation.
