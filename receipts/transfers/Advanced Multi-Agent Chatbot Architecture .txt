Slide 3: Agent Hierarchy
[Diagram showing hierarchical structure]

1. Supervisor Agent
   ├── Query Understanding Agent
   ├── Policy Retrieval Agent
   ├── Financial Analysis Agent
   ├── Plan Generation Agent
   ├── Compliance Checking Agent
   └── Response Formulation Agent

Slide 4: LangGraph Workflow
[Diagram showing the flow between agents, with LangGraph orchestrating]

1. Input → Supervisor Agent
2. Supervisor Agent delegates to specialized agents
3. Specialized agents perform tasks and return results
4. Supervisor Agent coordinates and synthesizes results
5. Output → Financial Advisor

Slide 5: Supervisor Agent
• Implements planning and reflection patterns
• Uses LangGraph's cycle feature for iterative improvement
• Manages overall workflow and agent coordination
• Implements human-in-the-loop approval for sensitive actions

---

Slide 6: Specialized Agents (ReAct-based)
• Query Understanding Agent
• Policy Retrieval Agent
• Financial Analysis Agent
• Plan Generation Agent
• Compliance Checking Agent
• Response Formulation Agent

Each agent:
- Implements ReAct architecture for flexible reasoning and tool use
- Has access to specific tools relevant to its domain
- Uses structured output for clear communication

Slide 7: State and Memory Management
• Custom State class to maintain conversation history and intermediate results
• Checkpointer for enabling human-in-the-loop interactions and time travel
• Caching mechanism for frequently accessed data
• Versioned storage of company policies and procedures

---

Slide 8: Human-in-the-Loop Features
• Approval workflow for sensitive actions (e.g., final plan recommendations)
• Ability to edit agent actions and decisions
• Time travel functionality to revisit and modify previous states
• Wait for input nodes for gathering additional information from advisors

---

Slide 9: Tool Integration
• Comprehensive toolset including:
  - Company policy database querying
  - Financial modeling and analysis tools
  - Compliance checking algorithms
  - Client data retrieval and update tools
• Tool calling implemented using LangChain's structured output capabilities

---

Slide 10: LangGraph Implementation Details
• Define nodes for each agent and major workflow step
• Implement complex edges for conditional branching and cycles
• Use Send API for map-reduce operations (e.g., analyzing multiple investment options)
• Leverage breakpoints for human-in-the-loop interactions
• Implement custom state update functions for fine-grained control

---

Slide 11: Scalability and Performance
• Asynchronous processing for non-blocking operations
• Horizontal scaling of agent instances based on demand
• Distributed caching for improved response times
• Optimized LLM calls with efficient prompting strategies

---

Slide 12: Security and Compliance
• End-to-end encryption for all inter-agent communications
• Role-based access control integrated into the State
• Comprehensive audit logging of all agent actions and decisions
• Regular security scans and updates

---

Slide 13: Continuous Learning and Improvement
• Feedback loops for each agent to improve performance
• A/B testing of agent algorithms and models
• Periodic retraining of ML models with new data
• Version control for agent logic and knowledge base
• Performance monitoring and alerting system

---

Slide 14: Implementation Roadmap
• Phase 1: Core LangGraph Structure and Supervisor Agent
• Phase 2: Individual Specialized Agent Development
• Phase 3: Tool Integration and ReAct Implementation
• Phase 4: State Management and Persistence Setup
• Phase 5: Human-in-the-Loop Features Implementation
• Phase 6: Security, Compliance, and Scalability Enhancements
• Phase 7: Testing, Refinement, and Deployment
